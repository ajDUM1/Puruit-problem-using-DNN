1. Ray_Marching - It is a sample of the ray marching algorithm which I have implement in the model. In this algorithm multiple rays are projected from the agent and these when these rays collide with some obstacle they are terminated and thats how the agent gets the radius from the obstacle.

2. Model - This file contains the code for the enviroment and the agents, also the training process is done here. In this file I used episode batching method for improving the speed of the model.
